				<H3><a href="">WiFi Access Control</a></H3>
				<p>In recent years, Wi-Fi has seen extraordinary growth;
				however, due to the cost, performance and security issues, many Wi-Fi hotspot owners would like to
				restrict the network access only to individuals inside the physical property.
				Unfortunately, due to the nature of wireless, this is difficult to accomplish, 
				especially with the off-the-shelf omni-antenna devices.
				We develop and implement CLaWa, a Crowdsourced Location Aware Wi-Fi Access Control scheme to address this challenge. 
				Our system is based on observations of differing characteristics of physical layer information across physical boundaries such as walls and corners.
				CLaWa crowdsources both channel state information (CSI) and received signal strength (RSS) of already validated users to classify future users.
				We have also selected an appropriate machine learning algorithm for CLaWa. </p>

				<H3><a href="">Security and Privacy in Vehicular and Social Networks</a></H3>
				<p>Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs) are promising platforms based on the deployment of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), 
				widely spreading from traffic management to entertainment. 
				VSNs would be viewed as the merging of the traditional vehicular networks and the social network involving various human factors. 
				Thus, The performance of content dissemination in VSNs heavily relies on the communication between vehicles, 
				and the behaviors of human beings inside. 
				Similar to the Online Social Network, some participants may present malicious behaviors to pursue personal benefits,
				e.g., Sybil or black hole attack. Some may even violate users’ privacy, 
				which leads to the exposure of users’ private information.
				Hence, the security and privacy-based solutions for content dissemination in VSNs have become extremely challenging. </p>

				<H3><a href=""> Medium Access Control</a></H3>
				<p>Currently, various Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols have been proposed for underwater wireless sensor networks.
				Unlike terrestrial networks, underwater networks utilize acoustic waves,
				which have comparatively lower loss and longer range in underwater environments.
				However, the use of acoustic waves incurs long propagation delays that typically lead to 
				low throughput especially in protocols that require receiver feedback 
				such as multimedia stream delivery and the energy cost of transmission is much higher than receptions.
				Thus, collision and retransmission should be reduced in practice in order to reduce energy cost and improve throughput. 
				Based on these motivations, we propose a novel MAC protocol called NCDCMAC. NCDC-MAC leverages network coding and duty cycle,
				the combination of which is seldom explored, to solve these challenges. Heterogeneous wireless networks and node roles are considered while designing our algorithms. 
				Meanwhile, fairness including schedule and service time assignment is supported in our approach. 
				Extensive simulations show that our approach can achieve significantly better performance.
