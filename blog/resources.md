### Resources

###### The Analysis and Design of Algorithm:
This course includes " The theoretical study of computer-program performance and resource usage ".Why study algorithms and performance? We have 6 reasons for you.1. Algorithms help us to understand scalability.2. Performance often draws the line between what is feasible and what is impossible.
3. Algorithmic mathematics provides a languagefor talking about program behavior.4. Performance is the currencyof computing.5. The lessons of program performance generalize to other computing resources
.6. Speed is fun!
